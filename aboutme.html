        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Who Is <strong>Brian Makau?</strong></h2>
            <p>Brian Makau is a Junior Developer on a journey to be among the best developers of his time. Like many other people I started out life from a very humble beginning, 
                but that's no reason to hold me back from achieving the absolute best that I could.</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I started out life as a smart kid. Not to toot my horn or anything but from a young age my friends, parents and teachers told me I had aptitude and was able to achieve great things. Unfortunately life was not that easy growing up. I came
                 up in a very hostile home. Life always threw obstacles at me but I was and still am a fighter, so  everything tossed my way, I was able to combat. I tried real hard 
                 and lucky enough I'm where I am today. The loss of my only parent was one of the hardest things to ever happen to me because she was my whole support system. I do not say all this to seek 
                 pity, but rather to show everyone that even they can make it if they're determined.
            </p>

            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <p>
                My education is the most important part of my life. School was like an escape to me when I was young and I got adapted quite fast. I was a gifted student in primary school 
                and even in high school I maintained the consistency. I graduated primary school in 2012 and perfomed fairly well. I enrolled to Mumbuni Boys' High School where I graduated from in 2016
                 and scored a B(plain) grade. After that I enrolled in Mount Kenya university to pursue a Bachelor Degree in Energy and Environmental Engineering. 
                 I finished this in 2020 and am now a proud student of <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> under the Access program.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
            <p>I decided to do programming out of curiosity and passion to know how to code. I really enjoyed the company of my developer friends and I always wanted to be 
                involved in what I saw them do. I did not hesitate to apply to Moringa School when I got the opportunity and luckily I made it. Coding is one of the things that 
                makes me extremely happy. I enjoy the thrill it gives me and the challenge it poses. The idea that I cannot learn all there is about coding is amazing. To get 
                to meet with different people, to learn from them and to maybe teach them a thing or two is purely amazing. <em>I couldn't ask for anything else!</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cycling- Cycling is one of the things I have loved from a young age. I did not have a bicycle of my own growing up but improvised a lot 
                    and found ways to enjoy riding bikes as much as I do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Swimming- Swimming is a sport as much as leisure to me. I enjoy the laid back afternoons that I spend enjoy a very cold swim. I also enjoy the weekly 
                    sessions I have for practice as well. It serves both of my want quite okay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Travelling- Part of the reason I chose coding is that I want to travel a lot, and I know coding will allow me this. I enjoy going to new places 
                    every now and then. Enjoying new environments and getting to learn different cultures and traditions of different places. It will allow me to 
                    see new sites and appreciate what I have and don't.
