        <h1 class="pageheading">My Projects</h1>
        <p>My coding journey has been quite young, but it is only beginning. In the short time that I have been coding I have done these projects:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Photography Website</li>
            <p>This is the first project I did. It is a depiction of a simple landing page for a photography website. The project is consistent of HTML and CSS only as it's languages.
                It is a little rusty for a first project but I am proud of what I did with a week's experience of coding skills. <a href="https://github.com/brian-makau/PhotographyWebsite">See more here</a>, or see the site here <a href="https://brian-makau.github.io/PhotographyWebsite/">https://brian-makau.github.io/PhotographyWebsite/</a>
            </p>

            <li>Street-Food Website</li>
            <p>The street-food website was a test to try and understand my skills in HTML and CSS. 
                It required recreating a provided image of a the landing page of a website. <a href="https://github.com/brian-makau/StreetFood-Website">This is the repository link for the project</a>, or the site here <a href="https://brian-makau.github.io/StreetFood-Website/">https://brian-makau.github.io/StreetFood-Website/</a>
            </p>

            <li>TREE-DOM 254</li>
            <p>TREE-DOM 254 is my biggest project so far. It involved four collaboraters, myself included. It is a website for an
                initiative created to help in the fight against deforestation by planting trees across the country among other means. 
                It is a nice initiative that we plan to maximize on and develop to the fullest. <a href="https://github.com/brian-makau/TREE-DOM_254">More information about the project</a>, or see it here: <a href="https://brian-makau.github.io/TREE-DOM_254/">https://brian-makau.github.io/TREE-DOM_254/</a>
